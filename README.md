# WELCOME TO MY PROJECT BRUH



i know it sucks but i need the experience my g.


If you wanna create a test for kids on geog about the us states and wanna have the questions jumbled up,(Absolutely nobody needs this...)
then this is the place to beeeeeeeeee.


All you have to do is just run the shell script


It works if youre on mac or linux 

or if youre on windows run python quizgame.py

And it should work boyyyyyyyyyy



Thanks bruhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
